In this page, we will present the various reasons one may want to use monggregate.

## **What monggregate is ?**

As a disclaimer, I'll start by saying what monggregate is not.

Monggregate **IS NOT** a MongoDB driver **NOR** an Object Document Mapper (ODM).

Monggregate can be seen as a NoSQL **query builder** for MongoDB.

If you are not familiar with the concept of query builder, I suggest you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1fCJ7sUXCM) from Arjan Codes where he explains the difference between using raw SQL, query builders and ORMs.
Even if the examples use SQL, there are still relevant in a NoSQL context.
